# `contract-chameleon`

## What is [contract-chameleon](https://github.com/Contract-LIB/contract-chameleon), and what not?

`contract-chameleon` is a translator to transfer
different formal specification contracts, into each other,
so the proven contracts in one tool can also be applied in another tool.
To make these translations scalable in the number of tools supported
it uses `Contract-LIB` based on `SML-LIB`
as an intermediate representation of the contracts.

Contract-Chameleon itself does not proof any implementation,
nor does it manage proofs.

## Some basic terminology

There is some basic terminology when it comes to `contract-chameleon`:
Simply speaking, every adapter is named from the perspective of `contract-chameleon`.

This means that `import` adapters take a specification
in one of the tool specific languages (e.g., `JML (JavaDL)`)
and translate it into a `Contract-LIB` specification.

However, `export` adapters translate a `Contract-LIB` specification
to an application's specification.
In contrast to the `import` adapters where only one use case exists,
there can be two ways to export a `Contract-LIB` specification.
The `provider` perspective generates the interface the implementation
needs to be proven against.
The `applicant` (or `client`) perspective only generates the specification
for an interface of a contract
that can be used in the client tool.

The following diagram visualizes this relation.

## Running the tool

The tool with all default adapters can be run with:

```sh
java -jar contract-chameleon-exe.jar <adapter-name>
```

### Help adapter

The help adapter provides information of the interface,
and shows the available adapters.

```sh
java -jar contract-chameleon-exe.jar help 

```

### Executing additional adapters

Place the `JAR` of the additional adapter next to the `contract-chameleon-exe.jar`:

```sh
java -cp '*' org.contract_lib.ContractChameleon help <adapter-name>
```

The additional `JAR` must have a file with the name `org.contract_lib.contract_chameleon.Adapter`
in `src/main/ressources/META-INF/services`
containing the full class name (including package) of the additional adapter.
Compare the following [example](./contract-chameleon.adapter.key.import/).

## Developing the tool

### Writing custom adapters for `contract-chameleon`

To write a custom adapter for `contract-chameleon`,
a basic template with recommendations is provided here:
[`adapter-extension`](https://github.com/Contract-LIB/contract-chameleon-adapter-extension):

### Building `contract-chameleon` locally

You can build the core package of `contract-chameleon` yourself,
with its dependencies by following the following steps:

1. Cloning the git directory

    ```sh
    git clone git@github.com:Contract-LIB/contract-chameleon.git contract-chameleon
    ```

1. Install required git submodules

    ```sh
    cd contract-chameleon
    # to fetch and initialize the submodules the first time
    git submodule update --init --recursive 
    ```

    ```sh
    # to pull changes from submodules
    git pull --rebase --recurse-submodules
    ```

1. Publish custom JML-Parser

    ```sh
    # Ensure to be at root of contract chameleon
    # cd contract-chameleon (or your folder name)
    cd libs/jmlparser
    ./mvnw clean install -DskipTests
    ls ~/.m2/repository/io/github/jmltoolkit/jmlparser-core/ #check that snapshot exists
    ```

1. Build `contract-chameleon` with `gradle`

    ```sh
    # Ensure to be at root of contract chameleon
    gradle clean build
    ```

1. Execute `contract-chameleon`

    ```sh
    gradle run --args="<adapter-name> <file_path>"
    ```

1. Run integration tests

    ```sh
    gradle run-integration-tests
    ```

### Accessing the JavaDoc

For each module the `JavaDoc` can be found in
`<module>/build/docs/javadoc/org/contract_lib/contract_chameleon/package-summary.html`.

### JavaDoc of Dependencies

#### jmlparser

```sh
# build Javadoc
./mvnw javadoc:javadoc
```

The `JavaDoc` can be found in for the different packages: `<jmlparser-module>/javaparser-core/target/reports/apidocs/index.html`

## Run integration tests with tools

### KeY

Requires `KeY: ci-tool`, `KeY`

```sh
# check if proofs can be found in key (see folder `tests.integration`)
gradle key_ci-check-all --continue
```

(under construction)

### VeriFast

Requires `verifast`

(under construction)
